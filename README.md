ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GriffinGoing

While studying music as a college undergraduate, I took an introductory computer programming course as an elective. 
Though it was difficult, I loved the creaitive possibilities I felt were now available to me. Making the decision to 
alter my career path, I prompty wrapped up my degree, transferred to GVSU, and began pursuing computer science as both 
a new career and a new passion. At the onset of my senior year, I began working as a Full Stack Developer for the 
industry-facing arm of the School of Computing, and gained a great deal of experience both interfacing with clients and 
delivering software solutions. Still possessing a love for the ongoing challenge to learn that a career in CS demands, 
I was honored to be accepted into the Masters of Applied Computer Science Program where I can be found today.
